      <h2>About This Project</h2>

      <p class="section-desc">
        This site was authored and developed by <strong>Sai Prakash Thota</strong>, under the
        guidance of <strong>Dr. Amer</strong>. It was created as part of the
        <strong>Curr Topics Human Comp Interac</strong> course project.
      </p>

      <p class="section-desc">
        The aim of this website is to help users understand the essential concepts of staying
        safe while shopping or banking online. The lessons are built to be simple, interactive,
        and visually appealing so users can learn comfortably.
      </p>

      <p class="section-desc">
        The platform includes <strong>10 short tutorials</strong>, each covering one important
        security concept — such as strong passwords, phishing attacks, secure website
        identification, OTP protection, safe vs unsafe Wi-Fi, and secure payment practices.
      </p>

      <p class="section-desc">
        The interface features a <strong>live animated background</strong>, <strong>glass-effect
        cards</strong>, and a clean layout that works smoothly on both mobile and desktop
        devices. A built-in progress system marks completed lessons in green to help users track
        their progress easily.
      </p>

      <p class="section-desc">
        This project applies key HCI principles such as simplicity, user feedback, visual
        hierarchy, accessibility, and user-centered design — while teaching practical online
        security skills that are essential in the digital world.
